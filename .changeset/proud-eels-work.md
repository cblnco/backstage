'@backstage/plugin-search': patch
---

Added `SearchModal` component.

Now you can import `SearchModal` in your apps:

```js
import { SearchModal } from '@backstage/plugin-search';
```

You can also use the `SidebarSearchModal` component to integrate it into the sidebar of your sample apps:

```js
import { SidebarSearchModal } from '@backstage/plugin-search';
```
